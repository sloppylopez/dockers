## 1.0.2-forever-alone
    KNOWN BUGS:
        * grunt-karma background test does not generate reports

    FIXED BUGS:
        * Nasty issue that i don't like, i will think what to do with this
          and prepare travis to test ONLY angular, because it seems he it's not able to test
          the docker build, shame...
          https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1196
          However we will fix this using Jenkins

          The simplest and cleanes and better solution is to use docker hub
          automated builds.

    FEATURES ADDED:
        * Istalled teamcity-ci to serve as a CI-CD for my backend, now i have a friend :)
